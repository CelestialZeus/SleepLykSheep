# SleepLykSheep

### An App made on REACT.JS for calculating the Sleep Hours using the concept of Sleep Cycles.

## HOW TO RUN THE APP ON YOUR PC?

## HOW IT WORKS?
The inertia of sleep is a physiological state
characterized by a decrease in motor skills and the
subjective feeling of drowsiness after a sudden
awakening (wake-up alarms). This state can vary in
intensity and durability according to the sleep phase
in which the sleep was interrupted.

## WHAT ARE THE SLEEP CYCLES?
Sleep cycles are rest periods of between 90 and 110
minutes in length, comprising five stages.

Stage 1.- It is the lightest part of the dream where
you can be easily awakened. During this stage, many
people experience sudden muscle contractions
preceded by a feeling of falling.

Stage 2.- The movement of the eyes stops and the
brain waves become slower with only an occasional
burst of rapid brain waves.

Stage 3.- There are extremely slow brain waves
called delta waves that are interspersed with smaller
and faster waves.

Stage 4.- The brain produces delta Waves almost
exclusively. Stages 3 and 4 are referred to as deep
sleep, and it is very difficult to wake someone from
them. When we are in deep sleep, there is no eye
movement or muscle activity.
REM stage (Rapid Eye Movement) :- It is when the
breathing becomes faster, superficial and irregular,
the eyes are quickly agitated and the muscles of the
limbs temporarily paralyzed. Brain waves during this
stage are similar to those experienced by people
when they are awake, the heart rate increases, blood
pressure rises, men experience erections and the
body loses some of the ability to regulate its
temperature. It is the time when most dreams occur,
if a person is awakened during REM sleep, he may be
able to remember dreams. Most individuals
experience three to five intervals of REM sleep each
night.

## WHEN TO AWAKEN?

In general it is better to wake up in the final part of the
REM stage or at the beginning of Stage 1.
